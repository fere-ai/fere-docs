A trading agent is a sentient agent that performs trades autonomously. This
agent is in charge of the decisions it takes.
You can provide prompts and personas which defines its character and trading
decisions.

:::tip
We recommend doing a simulation of your agents (by enabling it in `dry run` mode)
before making it perform on chain trades
:::

The Trading API provides endpoints for managing trading agents, monitoring portfolios,
and accessing trading signals.
This documentation covers authentication, endpoints, and
includes examples in Python and Node.js.

## Examples Repo

Complete working examples in Python and TypeScript are available on
[fere-ai/agentic-examples](https://github.com/fere-ai/agentic-examples).
Clone and use them for a quick start.

## Base URL
All endpoints are relative to: `https://api.fereai.xyz/ta/`
